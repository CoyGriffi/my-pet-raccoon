  <p>
    Jerry can very often be a handfull, and to ensure a safe
    encounter you will want to make sure to follow these
     <strong>strict</strong> guidelines.
  </p>
  <h2> Rules of encounter </h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Approach <strong>SLOWLY!</strong></li>
      <li>Always approach at Raccoon height as not to 
        intimidate him.</li>
      <li>Bring a treat as an offer of appeasment</li>
      <li>hand treat to Jerry with palms flat and open so he 
        knows you don't have a weapon</li>
